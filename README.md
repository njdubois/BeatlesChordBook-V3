# BeatlesChordBook-V3
Angular App made to ease reading of Beatles Chord books.

There is a Fest for Beatles fans yearly at the Hyatt in Rosemont, IL.  At this fest musicians flock and it's many big Beatles sing-alongs through out a whole weekend.

What I did was take apart a Bealtes guitar chord song book, scanned each page in, and made a series of Apps meant to display these pages on a touch screen device.  Eliminating the need to haul around the books, keep the page open while playing, and so on.

In this version, which is a basic Angular Js app, and I mean BASIC, I have each page laid out after the other, so you can scroll up and down, through all the pages for a current song.

In the previous versions, I had an invisible link cover the top half, and the bottom half of the page, and touch one moved to the next, or went back a page.  So while on stage, tapping next page was as easy as slapping the bottom half of the screen.

NOTE:  The app works based on a js file containing a json object that is all the available songs.  For this online public repo, I have only 3 songs from one album, and the chords and lyrics for those songs whited out for copyright reasons.  I don't want to get in trouble.  Of course I own the book, and have the full json object and all page images.
